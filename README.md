# [Cloud JupyterLab Workspace Launcher](https://beginnersc.github.io/)

* Public: Open the link with nbgitpuller without a token
* Private: Open with a token; so the Private option can actually be used to open public projects too
    * The advantage opening public projects with a token is that when pushing change back to GitHub there is no need to type in ID and password

* If Launch Empty, all input fields will be ignored
